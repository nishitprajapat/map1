In Germany, getting paid in cryptocurrency (i.e When you receive a payment as cryptocurrency), it is subject to income tax as fiat.  Also, airdrops are considered tax-free if the purchasable transaction has not been recorded. Is it is the same case for Interest on Crypto? The answer is no, as according to German Tax Law if the crypto is lent for investment purposes and any interest earned are treated as tax-free if held for more than 10 years rather than 1 year. Further, FIFO method is used for calculation of asset holding period. ",

Short-term holding and long-term holding does not have much impact on the tax side. However, if an investor is involved in trading actively and that will be considered as “business activity” and subject to income tax. That is the same case with mining, which states that if a miner with a systematic effort and intention of earning profits from mining activities, they are liable to pay taxes on the profits; however, individual mining crypto for hobby does not attract any tax. For the taxation purposes, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore categorizes digital tokens into three: Payment Token, Utility Token and Security Token. Payment token: For the transactions involving payment of goods or services are considered as barter trade and the value of goods or services transferred. Utility token is created with an objective of no other purpose of payment than to pay for goods and services. Security tokens usually describe many tokens issued by ICO. Buyers are intended to invest their money in ICO with the intention of making profits. Detailed characteristics and tax treatment of each token are mentioned in the IRAS website below:",

The DFSA determined in one instance that an ICO was not within its purview because "the relevant token did not grant financial or decision rights over the corporation or the corporation's earnings." As a result, the DFSA is unable to control tokens that do not provide investors control over a firm. Since they are not classified as financial services, cryptocurrencies that are functionally comparable to Bitcoins are not governed by the DFSA. Payments for services, currency exchanges, the issuance of electronic money, and payments for goods and services are all considered financial services in Denmark.
